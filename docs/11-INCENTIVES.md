# 11-INCENTIVES.md

## 1. Purpose

Incentives answer: **"What gets more likely over time?"**

For The Wove, we want to increase:

- Helpful remixes and rescues.

- Teaching and knowledge sharing.

- Structural kindness and gratitude.

- Sustainable contribution, not grind or clout chasing.

This doc defines the incentive model and the signals we surface.

## 2. Principles

1. **Impact over points**

   We prefer stories ("you helped X") over scores ("you have 1234 karma").

2. **Intrinsic over extrinsic**

   Incentives should align with:

   - Curiosity,

   - Mastery,

   - Connection,

   - Contribution.

3. **No leaderboard anxiety**

   Avoid public ranking of individuals. Celebrate work, not ego.

4. **Safety and kindness as first-class**

   Toxic contributions should not be rewarded, regardless of technical merit.

## 3. Core Incentive Channels

### 3.1 Gratitude (Thank You System)

See [Remix Culture](./07-REMIX-CULTURE.md) spec for details.

- Primary emotional incentive:

  - Receiving genuine thanks from people your work helped.

- Signals:

  - "You received a Thank You from [user]."

  - Periodic summaries:

    - "This month, your projects helped 7 people."

Thank You notes are:

- Private by default.

- Optionally quotable in anonymized form.

---

### 3.2 Impact Stories

Each project/remix can show:

- "Descendants" (remixes and lineages).

- "Rescues performed" (how many broken states fixed).

- "Learners helped" (Teaching Remix usage/context).

For a user's profile, we summarize:

- "Your patterns have been reused in X projects."

- "Your teaching remixes were used in Y learning sessions."

- "You've completed Z rescue missions."

These are *not* scored as points; they're narrative stats.

---

### 3.3 Challenges & Spotlights

**Official Challenges**

- Regular themed remix or build events.

- Recognition categories:

  - Best Teaching Remix.

  - Most impactful Rescue Mission.

  - Most surprising Vibe Shift.

  - Community Favorite (voted with non-toxic mechanisms).

**Spotlights**

- Feature:

  - Projects,

  - Remixes,

  - Teaching materials,

  - Innovative pipelines.

- Spotlight is about **work**, not the person's "rank".

Spotlights can appear:

- On landing page sections.

- In Learn/Discover.

- In newsletters or announcements.

---

### 3.4 Roles as Incentive: Room Hosts & Stewards

We treat roles as **responsibility badges**, not status badges.

- Criteria:

  - Demonstrated constructive behavior and kindness.

  - Consistent contribution to remixes/teaching, not just raw output.

- Benefits:

  - Influence over room norms and experiments.

  - Early access to experimental features (e.g. moderation tools, pipeline features).

Roles should always feel like:

> "I am trusted to help steward this space"

not

> "I am better than others."

---

## 4. Anti-Incentives (What We Avoid)

We intentionally avoid:

- Public karma scores.

- Global leaderboards of "top users".

- Incentives tied to:

  - Raw usage time,

  - Token consumption,

  - Number of posts/comments without impact.

We also:

- Discount or nullify "impact" attributed to:

  - Projects associated with repeated moderation issues.

  - Toxic or abusive behavior.

---

## 5. Micro-Nudges & UX Hooks

In-product nudges aligned with incentives:

- After a successful remix:

  - "Want to send a Thank You to the original creator?"

- After receiving help:

  - "Let [helper] know how this helped you?"

- After shipping:

  - "This is a great candidate for others to remix. Want to mark it as 'remix-friendly' and add a short note?"

For Teaching Remixes:

- "3 people remixed from your checkpoint. Want to improve the explanation or add another step?"

---

## 6. Long-Term Incentives

### 6.1 Reputation (Soft, Contextual)

Reputation is:

- Contextual:

  - Skilled in web apps, or teaching, or pipelines, etc.

- Derived from:

  - Remixes,

  - Teaching usage,

  - Challenges,

  - Steward/Host nominations.

Manifested as:

- "Known for…" tags on profile (e.g. "Rescue missions", "Teaching Next.js basics", "Frontend polish").

### 6.2 Economic Incentives (Future)

Potential future directions (not MVP):

- Creator funds / sponsorships:

  - Supporting teachers or pipeline builders whose work is widely used.

- Revenue sharing on:

  - Premium templates,

  - Advanced pipelines,

  - Enterprise-ready patterns.

These require careful design to avoid:

- Pay-to-win dynamics.

- Exploitative or extractive pressures.

Any economic layer must pass:

> "Does this still feel like a place to explore, learn, and help freely?"

---

## 7. Measuring Incentive Health

Key metrics:

- Ratio of Thank You notes to moderation incidents.

- % of projects with at least one remix.

- Average number of remixes per active user.

- Participation in challenges over time.

- Qualitative feedback:

  - "I feel recognized for my contributions."

  - "I feel safe experimenting and sharing work."

If metrics show:

- People hoarding work,

- Toxicity increasing,

- Or shallow "engagement hacks" dominating,

we adjust incentives, not just content.
