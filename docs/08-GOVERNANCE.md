# 08-GOVERNANCE.md

## 1. Purpose

Governance defines **how decisions are made**, **who has what powers**, and **how we keep The Wove aligned** with its core values:

- Structural kindness

- Remix-first collaboration

- Accessibility for non-traditional devs

- Transparency over mystique

This doc describes the initial governance model for The Wove.

---

## 2. Principles

1. **Transparent, not secretive**  

   Important decisions are documented and visible.

2. **Participation over hierarchy**  

   Community members have structured ways to influence direction without needing formal titles.

3. **Accountability with compassion**  

   Moderation and policy decisions are documented, appealable, and geared toward repair when possible.

4. **Pragmatic evolution**  

   Governance can change via visible processes; it's not frozen constitutionally from day one.

## 3. Roles

### 3.1 Core Team

- Product, design, engineering, and ops responsible for:

  - Shipping features,

  - Maintaining infra,

  - Implementing governance and moderation decisions.

Has final say on:

- Legal compliance,

- Security requirements,

- Company-level risk.

### 3.2 Stewards

Small group (5–9) of trusted community members with elevated responsibilities:

- Help maintain culture and norms.

- Review policy changes and significant product shifts that affect community experience.

- Resolve complex moderation cases with long-term impact.

Characteristics:

- Diverse backgrounds and experience levels.

- Limited, renewable terms (e.g. 6–12 months).

- Publicly listed with "office hours" for community concerns.

### 3.3 Room Hosts

For specific rooms (e.g. #beginners, #web-apps, #weird-experiments):

- Facilitate conversations and challenges.

- Help onboard new members to room norms.

- Escalate moderation issues when necessary.

Room Hosts:

- Are nominated or volunteer.

- Have lightweight powers (pin messages, launch room challenges, suggest featured remixes).

### 3.4 General Members

Any user with an account.

Rights:

- Participate in challenges, remixes, and rooms.

- Propose ideas via:

  - Feature request channels,

  - Remix-based RFCs (see below).

- Appeal moderation decisions through a clear process.

## 4. Decision Types

### 4.1 Product & Technical Decisions

**Examples:**

- New features.

- Stack changes.

- API access policies.

Handled by:

- Core Team, informed by:

  - Community feedback,

  - Usage metrics,

  - Public RFCs where impact is broad.

### 4.2 Policy & Norm Decisions

**Examples:**

- Code of conduct updates.

- Moderation guidelines.

- Room creation and sunsetting.

Handled by:

- Core Team + Stewards consensus.

- Documented as "Policy Notes," visible to all.

### 4.3 Community Experiments

**Examples:**

- New challenge formats.

- New remix recognition mechanisms.

- Prototype rooms or tags.

Handled by:

- Room Hosts + interested members.

- Low-stakes, time-bounded experiments.

- Results summarized and optionally standardized.

## 5. RFC Process (Request for Comments)

### 5.1 When to Use

RFCs are used when a change:

- Affects many users,

- Alters norms or policy,

- Substantially changes community-facing features (e.g. reputation systems).

### 5.2 How It Works

1. **Draft RFC**  

   - Created by Core Team, Steward, or community member.

   - Lives in a visible RFC space with:

     - Problem statement,

     - Proposal,

     - Alternatives,

     - Impact assessment.

2. **Feedback Window**  

   - Time-bounded (e.g. 7–14 days).

   - Anyone can comment, including via:

     - Text,

     - Demo projects or remixes illustrating ideas.

3. **Decision**  

   - Core Team + Stewards:

     - Accept,

     - Accept with modifications,

     - Reject (with explanation).

4. **Post-Mortem** (if needed)  

   - For significant changes:

     - Evaluate outcomes after a set period.

     - Decide whether to keep, tweak, or roll back.

---

## 6. Transparency

We commit to:

- **Public policy changelog**

  - List of all major governance, moderation, and policy decisions.

  - Summaries in human language, not just legalese.

- **Moderation transparency (aggregated)**

  - Publish anonymized stats:

    - Types of incidents,

    - Resolution outcomes,

    - Improvements made.

- **Community feedback loops**

  - Regular check-ins (e.g. quarterly):

    - Surveys,

    - Open calls,

    - Recorded Q&A sessions.

---

## 7. Evolution of Governance

Governance itself can change via:

1. Governance-focused RFCs.

2. Steward recommendations after:

   - Watching real issues over time,

   - Seeing patterns of friction or harm.

3. Legal/regulatory requirements (with clear explanation to community).

We start lightweight and opinionated, with room to evolve as The Wove grows.
